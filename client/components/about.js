      <p>
        Hello, I'm Joe, a seasoned full stack developer and software engineer
        based in the Greater New York City Area. With over eight years of tech
        industry experience, I embarked on my journey in technology as a
        computer forensic and cyber security analyst, serving both law
        enforcement agencies and private enterprises. Certified as a forensic
        examiner and trained by the United States Secret Service, I initially
        delved deep into the intricacies of digital security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeking to expand my horizons, I pursued a transformative path by
        enrolling in the rigorous seven-month Software Engineering Immersive
        bootcamp offered by Fullstack Academy. Emerging from the program, I
        acquired a comprehensive skill set enabling me to proficiently craft
        mobile and web applications as a full stack developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, as a Software Engineer II at EverTrue, I am dedicated to
        continuous growth, refining my engineering prowess, and embracing
        challenges that foster my development as a professional.
