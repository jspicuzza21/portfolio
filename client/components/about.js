      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hello, I'm Joe and I'm a full stack developer and software engineer based out of New York/Jersey City with over six years of experience in the Tech industry. I started my career in Tech as a computer forensic and cyber security analyst for both law enforcment agencies and private companies. I am a certified forensic examiner and have been trained by the United States Secret Service.</p>
      <p>Unsatisified with the field I was in, I decided to boost my technical skills by completing the seven month Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp taught by Fullstack Academy. After completing the course, I developed the skills necessary to be a full stack web developer capable of building mobile and web based applications.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work as a Junior Web Developer for BetMGM where I continue to hone my software engineering skills and work to improve as a developer every day.</p>
