      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hello, I'm Joe and I am a full stack web developer and software engineer based out of New York/Jersey City. I have over four years of experience working in digital forensics and cyber security for both law enforcment agencies and private companies. I have attended many trainings including a five week digital forensics training held by the United States Secret Service.</p>
      <p>Recently I decided to boost my technical computer skills by completing the seven month Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp taught by Fullstack Academy. After completing the course, I developed the skills necessary to be a full stack web developer capable of building mobile and web based applications.</p>
